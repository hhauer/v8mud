# V8Mud: A Multi-User Dungeon written in D.

This is a project that a friend and I worked on for a short time several years ago playing around with the D language long before it would be considered useful by anyone for anything.

I don't know if it'll compile. I don't know if it works. Uploaded primarily as a curiosity.
